Some important things to remember before going to lab:-

1. Follow the following commands for the successful program execution
   a) To compile: lex filename
                  cc lex.yy.c -lfl
   b) To execute: ./a.out
2. Many times output will not be shown after pressing "Enter Key" , in that case to see the output you have to press "ctrl+D"
3. If the program is taking input from a file, try to save the input file in the same folder in which the program is kept.
4. The source or the program filename must be saved with the extension "<Filename>.l"
